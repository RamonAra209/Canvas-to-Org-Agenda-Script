#+title: Canvas Todo list to Org Agenda

This Python script connects to Canvas' API with your Canvas token, grabs your todos and saves them into a org-agenda file!

The org todo entries are saved with the following format:

#+begin_src org
 * TODO <class>: <assignment>
   SCHEDULED: <assignment unlock time> DEADLINE: <assignment due date>
   <hyper link to assignment>
#+end_src

* TODO [#B] Some things I might add [0/2]
- [ ] Add an interactive CLI [0/5]
  + [ ] Ask the user where it would like to create the agenda file
  + [ ] Setup the intermediate json & org file to keep track of todos
  + [ ] Ask the user if they want to add classes to course /whitelist/
  + [ ] The format which their classes are saved in
        ... Since the todo entry depends on the class prefix being parsed correctly
- [ ] If I add the features above, finish this README!
