#+title: Canvas Todo list to Org Agenda

This Python script connects to Canvas' API with your Canvas token, grabs your todos and saves them into a org-agenda file!

The org todo entries are saved with the following format:

#+begin_src org
 * TODO <class>: <assignment>
   SCHEDULED: <assignment unlock time> DEADLINE: <assignment due date>
   <hyper link to assignment>
#+end_src
