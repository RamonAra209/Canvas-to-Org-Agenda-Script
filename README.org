#+title: Canvas todo list to Org Agenda

* TODO Preliminary Plan [2/5]
- [X] Connect to Canvas API
- [X] Get course data
- [ ] Parse data for assignment post/deadline dates
- [ ] ? See if there is a way to check if an assignment has a /grade/ attribute
    The grade attribute will as our 'filter' for filtering out assignments we actually care about
- [ ] Have a json file that acts as the intermediary between code + org todo file
   #+begin_src json
    "Classes" : {
        "COMP127" : {
            "Lab1" : {
                "Posted Date" : "<posted date>",
                "Deadline" : "<deadline>",
                "link": "<link to assignment>", // if possible
                "isDone" : False,}
            // ...
        }
        // ...
    }
   #+end_src
   The /isDone/ flag is going to act as our flag when we parse the org-todo for that specific assignment
   Since the json file is the intermediary between org + code, we'll need to parse the org file also.
   Switch /isDone/ to True when the the org agenda file says /DONE/ instead of /TODO/

   We'll use this json data to format the TODO entry
   #+begin_src python :results output
    todo_entry = []
    todo_entry.append(f"* TODO {class_}: {assignment_title} \n")
    todo_entry.append(f"    DEADLINE: <2022-08-31 Wed 09:00>")
    todo_entry.append(f"    Link: <link to assignment>")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
* Course TODO attributes to look into
- Todo objects relevant attributes:
  + Todo.assignment
  +
